# ImageKernel_HLS
Instead using traditional RTL, this project possibility of using Vitis HLS 
This project requires Vitis Vision Library.

https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries

To compile and run the testbench, you will need to include the library in your syn.cflag and syn.csimflags. as follows.

syn.cflags=-I/path to your Vitis_Libraries/vision/L1/include -I/path to your/Vitis_Libraries/vision/L1/include/common
syn.csimflags=I/path to your Vitis_Libraries/vision/L1/include -I/path to your/Vitis_Libraries/vision/L1/include/common

Due to the version incompatibility, this testbench doesn't use openCV function to read and write the image file. Instead, it can read in the grayscale image file in the hex file format and output the result image in the .pgm format.

Due to the long time it takes to do co-simulation in Vitis Unified IDE for some reasons, I create a vivado project using .tcl and add a simplified (non-UVM) testbench to simulate the verilog files generated by HLS synthesis tool. The simulation result after sobel 3x3 filter is as shown:
